\section{Introduction} \label{introduzione}
\pagenumbering{arabic}
\subsection{Purpose}
With the Design Document we would like to make the idea of Travlendar+ application more precise and more detailed.
In particular the main goal of the DD is  to describe the system in terms of architectural design choices.
It is written in particular for developers to help them to identify the architectural styles, the design patterns, the main components and their interfaces and, last but not least, the runtime behaviour.


\subsection{Scope}
The system aims to provide a complete calendar to users which are also helped to find the best route to reach their meetings and their appointments. 
Users can insert their meetings in order to have an agenda organized in a perfect way: they can see their trips of the day, their itineraries between appointments. Users can choose between different travel options basing on distances, travel time, cost.
The system provides some features to personalize the application in order to please users. In fact they can specify lunch time, they can activate or deactivate some travel means, they can also  choose for instance to minimize the walking distance or the carbon footprint. 
With this new application, people and their smartphones can have a lot of appointments in different locations without having the concern about plan the way to reach them. Obviously if two meetings overlap or if it is not possible to reach one, the system will advice users.

\subsection{Definitions, Acronyms, Abbreviations}
\subsection{Definitions} TODO CHECK AND CHANGE --> COPIED FROM RASD
\begin{itemize}
\item Visitor: a person that is not registered yet, but has the access to the application’s information.
\item Registered user: a person that is logged in the system and can create meetings.
\item Activity: an event that happens in the real world and that could be a meeting or a break.
\item Meeting: an activity among the registered user and other people. It can be created, modified and deleted by the meeting’s creator.
\item Break: an activity that a registered user can insert in order to manage it in a customizable way.
\item Trip: it indicates the route and the travel means chosen, based on user’s preferences.
\item Location: fixed place where a user stands or where he/she has to attend a meeting.
\item Global preferences: they are global attributes that registered users can modify and those are valid for all trips (i.e. minimize carbon footprint).
\item Creation screen: the screen of the application in which the registered user create a meeting or a break and enters its related details.
\item Blocked travel means: it is a travel means that the user has selected as unwanted.
\item Warning: a message directed to the user that arrives to him in form of a notification and can be shown on the application screen. It is generated by the system when there are some impediments for a trip (bad weather, strikes, traffic...) or when there are some problems (invalid data during the registration process or during the creation of an activity etc).

This document is structured as follows:
\paragraph{Section 1: Introduction}
In this section it is described the purpose and the main goals  of the document giving a general description.
\paragraph{Section 2: Architectural Design}
It gives a general view on how the architecture of Travlendar+ should be showing architectural choices, styles and patterns.
\paragraph{Section 3: Algorithm Design}

\section{Architectural Design}
\subsection{Overview}
This section deals with the architecture of Travlendar+. It is written to explain architectural choices made for the system. These decisions are supported by different diagrams to highlight the view of components and their interactions and to clarify architectural styles adopted in a better way.

The most suitable system architecture that will allow to satisfy all requirements is a three tier architecture. It is helpful also because allows any of the three tiers to be upgraded or replaced independently in response to changes in requirements or technology.
In this pattern, we have three subsystems to decouple logic and data, logic and presentation: 
\begin{itemize}
\item Presentation layer: it is the topmost level of the application. It provides a graphic user interface to the client and it communicates with other levels by which it puts out the results to the client displaying information  related to the services and also acquires its inputs to send to other tiers.
\item Application layer:  it is the mid level. It controls Travlendar+'s functionalities by performing detailed computation. It coordinates the application, processes commands, makes logical decisions and evaluations and perform calculations. This layer also interacts with external systems that support our application.
\item Data layer: it is the level in which information are stored and managed. It includes the data persistence mechanisms (database servers, file shares etc.) and the data access layer that encapsulates the persistence mechanism and exposes the data. It is kept independent from application logic and presentation layer.
\end{itemize}

TODO HIGH LEVEL COMPONENTS
\subsection{Component View}
In this section we will present the whole system. We will focus on all components and their interactions. This diagram will provide also an overview on interfaces that components provide for interactions.
\subsection{Deployment View}
TODO INSERIRE DEPLOYMENT

In  this section we want to show the deployment of our application showing the physical structure of the system.
We will use two servers, one for the application and the other for the data. We do not specify the type of the server to use but it should be powerful enough to support all data and all requests that there will be.

The application server will run on the execution environment JavaEE and communication with the database are possible thanks to Java Persistence API which will wrap all database functionalities.
The application server will handle all the logic behind the system.

The database server will run on the DBMS with the software MySQL. We will choose this software because it is reliable and moreover it is widely spread. This server communicates only with the application server.

Clients can use application through smartphones or tablets. The application will communicate with the application server in a direct way.

\subsection{Runtime View}
\subsection{Component Interfaces}
\subsection{Selected Architectural Styles and Patterns}
\subsubsection{Three-Tier Architecture} 
As we said before the architectural style that we have chosen for our application is a standard three-tier architecture. The tiers are the following:
1. GUI Tier: Thin clients. They display information and make the different services and functionalities reachable from the client. Clients can communicate with other tiers.
2. Application Tier: It controls application functionality, manages requests coming from the clients and sends results, data and notifications to them. It retrieves data from the Data Tier.
3. Database Tier: Houses database servers where information is stored and retrieved. Data in this tier is kept independent of application servers.

\subsubsection{Design Pattern}
We will list all design patterns that we think can be useful for Travlendar+.

\begin{itemize}
\item Client-Server
\item MVC Pattern
\item State Pattern
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Client Server}
The application is designed to follow the Client-Server communication model. Travlendar+ should be distributed, reachable from a large number of different devices and it needs to provide the service to all of them.
We would like to have thin clients: we design the server to manage requests and data, while the client should only see results and provides the user with the possibility of exploiting every functionality that they can use.
Moreover the client-server model allows our system to have high maintainability and scalability.
